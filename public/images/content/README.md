# Content Images

This folder contains images used in markdown content files.

## How to use images in markdown files

1. Place your image files in this directory (`public/images/content/`)

2. In your markdown files (in the `content/` folder), reference images using:

```markdown
![Alt text description](/images/content/your-image.jpg)
```

## Example

If you have an image named `example-diagram.png` in this folder, use it in markdown like:

```markdown
![Example diagram showing the process](/images/content/example-diagram.png)
```

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `teaching-methods-diagram.png`)
- Include alt text for accessibility
- Recommended formats: PNG, JPG, or SVG
- Optimize images before uploading (keep file sizes reasonable)
- The images will be responsive and styled automatically with rounded corners and borders
