# Differentiated Instruction

The practice of modifying teaching methods to meet the diverse needs of all students in a classroom.

### Areas of Differentiation
This can involve varying:
- **Content**: What the student needs to learn or how the student will get access to the information.
- **Process**: Activities in which the student engages in order to make sense of or master the content.
- **Products**: Culminating projects that ask the student to rehearse, apply, and extend what he or she has learned in a unit.
- **Learning Environment**: The way the classroom works and feels.
