# The Socratic Method

Based on the teaching style of the Greek philosopher Socrates, this method uses a series of questions to lead students to discover knowledge for themselves. 

It emphasizes:
- **Critical thinking**: evaluating arguments and evidence.
- **Logical reasoning**: constructing valid arguments.
- **Active participation**: the learner is not passive.

### Key Components
1. **Irony**: The teacher pretends ignorance to encourage the student to explain.
2. **Maieutics**: "Midwifery" of thought help bring the student's ideas to birth.
3. **Dialectic**: Cooperative argument/dialogue to find truth.
